    Newton was a genius, but not because of the superior computational
    power of his brain.  Newton's genius was, on the contrary, his
    ability to simplify, idealize, and streamline the world so that it
    became, in some measure, tractable to the brains of perfectly 
    ordinary men.

    Every time I write about the impossibility of effectively protecting
    digital files on a general purpose computer, I get responses from
    people decrying the death of copyright.  "How will authors and
    artists get paid for their work?" they ask me.  Truth be told, I
    don't know.  I feel rather like the physicist who just explained
    relativity to a group of would-be interstellar travelers, only
    to be asked: "How do you expect us to get to the stars, then?"  I'm
    sorry, but I don't know that, either.

    Good engineering is not a matter of creativity or centering or
    grounding or inspiration or lateral thinking, as useful as those might
    be, but of decoding the clever, even witty, messages the solution
    space carves on the corpses of the ideas in which you believed with
    all your heart, and then building the road to the next message.

    It would be well if engineering were less generally thought of, and
    even defined, as the art of constructing.  In a certain important
    sense it is rather the art of not constructing: or, to define it
    rudely, but not inaptly, it is the art of doing well with one dollar,
    which any bungler can do with two after a fashion.

    Simplicity does not mean want or poverty. It does not mean the absence 
    of any decor, or absolute nudity. It only means that the decor should 
    belong intimately to the design proper, and that anything foreign to 
    it should be taken away.

    Every task involves constraint,
    Solve the thing without complaint;
    There are magic links and chains
    Forged to loose our rigid brains.
    Structures, structures, though they bind,
    Strangely liberate the mind.
